Complexity Regression Tests

Ensures that refactored functions maintain low complexity and don't regress
back to high complexity levels.

These tests analyze the actual source code complexity metrics to prevent
complexity creep after refactoring.

## Test Suite Overview

### TestComplexityRegression
Tests specific critical functions that have been refactored or identified
for refactoring. Ensures they don't exceed their assigned thresholds.

Currently tracking 10 critical functions across:
- Deduplication applicator (refactored)
- Complexity analysis tools (refactored)
- Code smell detection (refactored)
- Schema.org client (needs refactoring)
- Score calculator (successfully refactored)

### TestComplexityTrends
Monitors complexity trends across the ENTIRE codebase:

1. **test_no_functions_exceed_critical_thresholds** (EXPECTED TO FAIL)
   - Scans ALL functions in src/ for critical threshold violations
   - Critical thresholds: cyclomatic≤20, cognitive≤30, nesting≤6, lines≤150
   - Currently identifies 53 functions needing refactoring
   - As refactoring progresses, this number should decrease to zero
   - When it reaches zero, the test will pass

2. **test_codebase_health_metrics**
   - Tracks overall codebase health (averages, percentages)
   - Provides visibility into complexity trends
   - Warns when health targets are exceeded (doesn't fail)

3. **test_no_extremely_complex_functions**
   - Ensures refactored files don't have extreme complexity
   - More targeted than the full codebase scan

## Usage

Run all complexity tests:
    uv run pytest tests/quality/test_complexity_regression.py -v

Run only passing tests (skip critical threshold check):
    uv run pytest tests/quality/test_complexity_regression.py -v \
        -k "not test_no_functions_exceed_critical_thresholds"

See health metrics report:
    uv run pytest tests/quality/test_complexity_regression.py::TestComplexityTrends::test_codebase_health_metrics -v -s

## Interpreting Results

- **14/15 tests passing** = Expected state (53 functions need refactoring)
- **15/15 tests passing** = All refactoring complete! 🎉
- **<14 tests passing** = Regression detected - investigate immediately

## Integration with CI/CD

Add to CI pipeline as a quality gate that warns but doesn't block:
    pytest tests/quality/test_complexity_regression.py || echo "Complexity issues detected"
