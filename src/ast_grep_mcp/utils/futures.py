"""Daemon-thread pool helper enforcing per-item timeouts.

The corrected wait lifecycle lives here once, shared by deduplication
enrichment, batch test-coverage checks, and cross-language search:

- Wait on each future directly with ``future.result(timeout=...)`` —
  ``as_completed()`` without a timeout only yields finished futures, which
  makes a per-item timeout unreachable and lets one hung worker block forever.
- Workers are daemon threads, not a ``ThreadPoolExecutor``: the executor's
  workers are non-daemon and joined both by ``concurrent.futures``' atexit
  hook and by ``threading._shutdown``, so a single permanently hung worker
  blocks clean interpreter exit until SIGKILL. Daemon workers never block
  exit; a worker still hung at return time is abandoned, counted, and logged.
- Cancel a future the moment its wait fails — a cancelled future's work item
  is skipped by its worker (``set_running_or_notify_cancel``), so an item
  already reported as timed out can never start running later.
- Pass ``total_timeout_seconds`` to bound the total wall-clock for the entire
  call to T seconds instead of N × per-item timeout.
- Wait expiries are delivered as ``WaitTimeoutError``; a ``TimeoutError``
  raised by ``func`` itself passes through unchanged, so adopters never
  mistake a worker-raised timeout (``socket.timeout``, ``OSError(ETIMEDOUT)``
  — all the builtin ``TimeoutError`` on Python 3.11+) for a wait expiry.

    """Run ``func`` over ``items`` on daemon worker threads, bounding each wait.

    Waits happen in submission order, each bounded by ``timeout_seconds``
    measured from when the wait loop reaches that item's future — so total
    wall clock is up to ``len(items) * timeout_seconds`` when everything
    hangs, and an item queued behind hung workers is reported as timed out
    even though it never ran.

    When ``total_timeout_seconds`` is set, a shared deadline is computed once
    at entry and caps every item's wait at ``min(timeout_seconds, remaining)``.
    Items whose deadline has already expired when the loop reaches them are
    reported as ``TimeoutError`` immediately without submitting a
    ``future.result()`` call, so total wall-clock is bounded to
    ``total_timeout_seconds`` regardless of how many items hang.

    A worker that outlives its timeout is abandoned: it keeps running but its
    result is discarded. ``func`` therefore must not mutate state the caller
    reads after this returns — hand workers private copies and merge results
    in ``on_success``. Workers are daemon threads: an abandoned worker keeps
    its thread (and pins its in-flight item) until it finishes, but never
    blocks interpreter exit — at exit it is terminated abruptly, so ``func``
    must not perform writes that corrupt state if killed mid-operation.
    Workers still running at return time are counted and logged as a warning
    (``abandoned_worker_threads``) so leak accumulation is observable; the
    work queue is drained on return so cancelled queued items are not pinned
    in memory by a hung worker's reference to it.

    Every failed wait cancels its future before ``on_error`` runs: an item
    still queued when it is reported failed can never start later, even if
    the callback unblocks a worker (cancelling a running or finished future
    is a no-op — running workers are abandoned, not stopped).

    Callbacks must not raise: a raising callback aborts the wait loop, skipping
    callbacks for every remaining item (queued work is still cancelled).

    Args:
        items: Work items, one future each.
        func: Called as ``func(item)`` on a daemon worker thread.
        timeout_seconds: Maximum seconds to wait for each individual item.
        max_workers: Number of worker threads for this call.
        on_success: Called on the calling thread with ``(item, result)`` for
            each item completing within its wait window.
        on_error: Called on the calling thread with ``(item, exception)`` when
            the wait timed out (a ``WaitTimeoutError``) or ``func`` raised
            (the original exception, including a ``func``-raised
            ``TimeoutError``, which is never rewrapped).
        total_timeout_seconds: Optional shared wall-clock deadline for all
            items combined. When set, each item's wait is capped at
            ``min(timeout_seconds, remaining_time)`` and items reached after
            the deadline has elapsed are reported as ``WaitTimeoutError``
            immediately. Default ``None`` disables the shared deadline.
